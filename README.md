## Overview

In this exercise, we explore how to sense DeviceMotion on a mobile device using JavaScript and Edge ML. Additionally, we use a Jupyter notebook for analyzing the collected sensor data, training various machine learning models, and optimizing them for specific tasks.

## Folder Structure

- **JS Folder**: Contains the JavaScript code used in CodeSandbox for sensing DeviceMotion on a mobile device using Edge ML and JavaScript.

- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for analyzing sensor data, training machine learning models, and optimizing them. Detailed explanations and steps are provided within the notebooks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this exercise, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

https://github.com/roman-weis/context-sensitive-systems.git


2. Explore the `JS Folder` for the mobile device sensor data collection code.

3. Navigate to the `Notebooks` directory to access Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Usage

- **Mobile Device Data Collection (JavaScript)**: Refer to the code and documentation in the `JS Folder` for instructions on setting up and running the code to collect DeviceMotion data from mobile devices using Edge ML.

- **Data Analysis and Machine Learning (Jupyter Notebooks)**: Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory for detailed steps on analyzing sensor data, training machine learning models, and optimizing them for context-sensitive applications.
